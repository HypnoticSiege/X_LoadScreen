Welcome to X_LoadScreen made for your FiveM servers!
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Inside this package you will find all the files you need in the "html" folder

The "index.html" file will be what does the basic things of the loadscreen.
You can change the "logo.png" to *YOUR LOGO* but rename it to "logo.png" for it to work or change the HTML file to change it.

The "main.css" file is where you can change the progress bar color and background color (I do not suggest changing things if you don'y know basic CSS)

The "main.js" file is what controls the progress bar you see at the bottom. (DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE OR YOU MAY BREAK IT)

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1. Unzip folder into your "resources" folder of your server
2. Go to your "server.cfg" file and add  the line "start X_LoadScreen
